# Python_ProblemSolving

A personal log of Python problems and solutions to improve logical thinking and problem-solving skills.

## About
This repository is a place for tracking problems you solve and the approaches you used. The goal is practice and progress — not production-ready libraries or polished projects. Problems may be from coding-challenge sites, interviews, contests, tutorials, or self-designed exercises.

## What to Expect
- Short problem statements or links to the original problem
- One or more Python solutions per problem (focused on clarity and reasoning)
- Notes on approach, edge cases, and complexity (when useful)
- Occasional small scripts or helper utilities used while solving problems

Note: This repository is intended as a personal practice log — it does not currently include automated tests or CI. It’s a place to record progress and revisit past problems.

## Suggested Structure
Use this simple layout to keep things organized:
- problems/ — problem descriptions, links, notes
- solutions/ — solution files grouped by topic (arrays, strings, dp, etc.)
- notebooks/ — optional: exploratory work or experiments
- README.md — this file

Example file naming:
- solutions/arrays/two_sum.py
- solutions/strings/reverse_words.py

## How to Add a Solution
1. Create a descriptive file name and place it under an appropriate folder in solutions/.
2. Add a short header comment with:
   - Problem name or link
   - A one‑paragraph approach summary
   - Time and space complexity (optional)
   - Example input/output
3. Keep solutions readable and well-commented so you can learn from them later.

Example header for a solution file:
"""Two Sum
Given an array of integers and a target, return indices of the two numbers such that they add up to target.

Approach: Use a hashmap to store seen values and their indices.
Time complexity: O(n)
Space complexity: O(n)
"""

## Coding Style
- Target Python 3.8+
- Follow PEP 8 for readability
- Prefer clear variable/function names and short functions
- Add comments to explain non-obvious steps
